# DIY_intranet
A homemade mesh network for finding friends and exploring the urban outdoors during a pandemic.

## Project Scope
The _DIY_intranet_ project seeks to create a functioning mesh network and explore the use cases of such a network in a social, urban environment. The diy_intranet project is a branch of the Cooper Union seminar [_The Street Finds its Own Uses for Things_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street).

## LoRa
The project makes use of the LoRa **Lo**ng **Ra**nge, low-power wide-area network protocol to transmit and recieve information over a distance of several city blocks. LoRa transmits messages via specific radio frequency ranges. This project's testing was performed in New York City, so the North American/Australian frequency band was used. This frequency band is nominally the 915MHz band, but is composed of a radio frequency range from 902 to 928 MHz.
